Hello, I'm **Eyal Yaacov**, and I'm passionate about the ever-evolving world of technology, with a particular focus on **distributed databases**, **distributed systems**, **DevOps** and all around **Automations**.

**Who Am I?**

I am a dedicated technological engineer, driven by a relentless curiosity to understand the inner workings of distributed systems and databases. Over the years, I've had the privilege to explore these realms in depth, learning, and growing with the fast-paced technology landscape.

**Distributed Databases** are the backbone of modern applications. From relational databases to NoSQL variants, I've explored the diverse landscape of database technologies. I've marveled at the art of optimizing queries, ensuring data consistency, and providing efficient storage solutions.
The challenge of distributing data across multiple nodes and ensuring its integrity and availability fuels my drive to delve deeper into this complex domain.


Understanding how **Distributed Systems** function is a journey that never truly ends. It's a thrilling puzzle where pieces are continually added or moved. My passion for distributed systems has led me to unravel their intricate architecture, learn from their nuances, and, ultimately, apply this knowledge to build efficient and resilient distributed solutions.


In the age of continuous evolution, **DevOps** is at the heart of seamless software development and deployment. I've embraced DevOps practices, from automating workflows to ensuring the reliability and scalability of systems.

**My Mission: *Bridging the Gap***

My mission is clear: to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical aspects of technology. I strive to make complex concepts accessible and practical, bringing the world of distributed databases, distributed systems, databases, and DevOps closer to fellow enthusiasts and professionals.

I look forward to connecting, collaborating, and learning from each other in this dynamic world of technology.

*I invite you to join me as I explore the frontiers of technology, sharing insights, discoveries, and experiences along the way...*
